Snowboard Gear Recommendation APP MVP (MERN)
---
General: There are alot of snowboarding products on the market that range for the different types of snowboarding conditions. To find which products work the best for your condition type, it takes alot of research to answer some very simple standards that come to product fit. This app intends to take these standards and provide custom recommendations at a high level to help get the user started on their snowboarding product fit journey sooner than the current process on the web.

Problem Statement: As a user, I want to have custom recommendations for snowboard gear types such as board style, board height, boot stiffness, & binding stiffness based on my personal parameters and goals as a snowboarder, so that I dont have to spend alot of time searching and learning the market to find the right gear for me.
